I am a PhD student at Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al. My advisors are Marc Schoenwiesner and Yoshua Bengio. I also collaborate with Elia Formisano's group at Maastricht University and Daniel Willet's team at Nuance Communications. My PhD research is focused on intermediate acoustic representations in human and machine hearing using deep learning and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I'm interested in the philosophy of neuroscience and epistemological questions about how to understand complex information processing systems. My goal is to develop methodologies for studying the computational mechanisms of sensory perception grounded in a philosophical and statistical framework that reflects the nature of the desired understanding and the limitations of the available measurements.
