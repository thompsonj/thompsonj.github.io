I recently gave a couple of educational tutorials which were recorded:

* [Comparing the activity of artificial and biological networks](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/main2020/30) at the 2020 Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience Symposium (MAIN2020)
* [Introduction to Scientific Explanation of Cognition](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/senai2021/1) at our Symposium on Explanation in Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence
