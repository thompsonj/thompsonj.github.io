In the Alphabet Soup series, I disambiguate terms that are commonly used in many different ways depending on the field of study or author.

Representation

* Representation learning
* Neuroimaging/Representational similarity analysis
* Cognitive Science -  


Marr 1984
> A *representation* is a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this. And I shall call the result of using a representation to describe a given entity a *description* of the entity in that representation (Marr and Nishihara, 1978) p. 20

37 is the Arabic numeral system's description of the number, which makes explicit certain information about the number's decomposition into powers of 10. Other numerical representations would describe the same number with different specific information. From the arabic representation, it is easy to determine whether the number is a power of 10, but difficult to discover whether it is a power of 2 (difficult for us). Any representation makes some information explicit at the cost of other information. How information is represented affects what can be done with it.

more examples of representations:  musical score, alphabet, shape

"formal scheme" information processing systems use symbols to represent things, formal scheme is set of rules for putting symbols together


future terms:
"generative"
"top-down, bottom-up, inside-out, outside-in"
"black-box"
"feature" "dimension"
