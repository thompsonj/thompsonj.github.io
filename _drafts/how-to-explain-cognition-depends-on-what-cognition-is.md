# Computational Explanation in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience

### Physical computation
One's conception of what it is they are studying, what it is that the brain is doing, has profound ramifications on how it is studied and what types of theories or explanations are accepted. Therefore, unfortunately we cannot completely separate the ontological question (what is cognition?) from the estimological question (how do we explain cognition?), as much as I wish we could...

What makes a computer a computer? What is computatation? Does a stomach compute? Is a computational model of the stomach fundamentally different than a computational model of the brain or cognition? Is there something special about computation?

I wish I could avoid these questions about computation per se. What distinguishes physical systems that compute from those that do not? This question doesn't seem necessary here where we accept that biological organisms exhibit intelligence as do artificial systems to some extent. Regardless of if we call it computation, we want to explain their function. In that sense maybe I don't care about the difference between a stomach and a brain. But on the other hand, maybe there is something to the comparison of different types of "computational models".

Mechanistic account of physical computation (piccini 2016)

casual account (chalmers 2011) (same as implementation account?) some systems are computational because they exhibit certain properties in virtue of their computational structure. Computational systems are invaraint with respect to their causal structure, unlike a stomach. but is this an instance of a mapping argument which milkowski says falls flat?

also Putnam, copeland for mapping example



theories of computation
1. formal symbol manipulation, formal logic. implies meaning/semantics, physically realized, mechanism is subject to norms that come from the semantics. but semantics is not a local mechanical process.
2. effective computatability, turing machines. CS say this is how computation is defined. Who has the authority to define? Is computuation a natural phenomenon? or is it just an idea that computer scientists control?
3. information processors
4. digital

brian cantwell thinks these are all wrong. Take instead take empirical approach,
"we build them therefore we understand them" no "engineering approach"
can they be explained by mechanistic account?
explanations come from logic instead of mechanisms, so it's not about machines its about the idea of abstract computation. Brian says computer are not machines. "machine" has baggage, set assign presumptions.

accounts of computation:
1. Mapping
2. Semantic

little focus on learning. Is understanding the principles by which a system learns (the focus of much machine learning research) necessary or sufficient to understand the function of the system once it has learned? This disussion is absent from most theories of computation, but underlies the "engineering approach" to understand the primate visual system, espoused most clearly by Jim DiCarlo.
How the system learns will have direct impact on the types of functions/representations/actions that are found in the trained system.
Explaining learning and explaining function of learned system not completely separate, but also not to be confused as one in the same. Learnability more important than universality.

### What do scientists say?

what makes a good theory?

In response to the claim that a good theory of brain must be a large, multscale computational model, Ilya Nemenman,  "'Don't model bulldozers with quarks' (Goldenfeld and Kadanoff, 1999) Theories must lose details and must be developed to explain limited sets of phenomena. Otherwise, the best material mode of a cat is another, or preferably the same, cat. (Philsophy of Science, Wiener and Rosenblueth, 1945)"
good theory is one that accurately explains a limited set of phenomena and throws away everything is wasn't designed for. No theory of everything.
Theories vs Models
theories or models vs simulations. Buidling a cat may be one way to validate a theory of a cat?

what makes a good theory?
-avoid a map on the scale of 1 to 1, because they explain everything if you tweak a few parameters
-Falsifiable but not yet falsified. but what is falsifiable?
-q-bio quantitaive biology, time for q-philosophy
-Philsophy has failed to define science (Laudan) maybe we don't need philosophy and can rely on usual process of science (i doubt it?)
-Claim: bayesian statistics can already tell us what is falisifiable. (DISAGREE) if theory does not explain observed data then theory is falsified. If theory can explain any dataset, then it is unfalsifiable. bayesian model selection
Goodness of theory related to generalization and prediction, with little regard to whether it is true. Falsifiability then real-valued and empirical. If it explains the data, we don't care if it is correct or not. (IS THIS A JOKE?)
so then good theories oare phenomenological ones that can predict your data and generalize to new data. Will only expalin the specific questions they were designed to answer. (HMM) Bottom up (details to coarse grain) vs top down (start with crude, gradually add).
Makes assumptions about parsimony, best model is the one that explains the data best with the simplest model.


just skips the question alltogether. Where did your data come from? How was the experiment designed? Treats data as some fundamental element and science is about predicting Data. Data does not come from nowhere.
